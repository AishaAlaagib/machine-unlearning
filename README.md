# Machine Unlearning Sisa

This repository contains the core code used in our SISA experiments along with some example scripts.

You can start runing experiments by having a look at the readme in the purchase example folder at ``example-scripts/purchase-sharding``.

``sisa.py`` is the script that trains a given shard. It should be run as many times as the number of shards.
